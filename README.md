This is an implemenetation of the minimal logic language described in:

## Quick tour

- To use, `load microkanren.ijs`
- Only has the equality constraint for now.
- Only the pure core language is implemented, *i.e.* no impure operators such as conda, condu, etc. No conde, disj+ or conj+ either.
- Yes, at the moment it is a pain to use but I hope to make that change.

### renaming of functions from the paper

- var? -> var
- find -> get
- occurs? -> occ
- ext-s -> ext
- unify -> uni
- == -> equ
- call/fresh -> fsh
- $append -> app
- $append-map -> apm
- disj -> dis
- conj -> con
- pull -> pul
- take -> tak
- call/initial-state -> cis

## Examples

### infinite streams
`10 cis fives`

### interleaving search
`3 cis fives_and_sixes`

### peano numbers (currently, the pinnacle of this library)
`5 cis peano`

## Future directions

- polish the current implementation a bit
- implement the constraint store using Jd, the embedded J columnar-store
- moar constraints, make it easier to use
